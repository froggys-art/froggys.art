        <p>
          Froggys is a community-driven project built by <strong>OG holders and supporters of the 2023 Bitcoin Frogs</strong>.
          While Bitcoin Frogs set the stage, Froggys steps in to push the culture forward, proving that frogs on Bitcoin still have more to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page introduces the mission, vision, and cultural intent of Froggys, a collection created to
          <strong> make frogs great again</strong>.

        <h2 className="font-8bit text-xl">Origins</h2>
        <p>
          Bitcoin Frogs was launched in March 2023 by a pseudonymous founder. The project became iconic but suffered from a
          <strong> lack of ongoing leadership, activations, and direction</strong>. That’s where Froggys comes in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Founded by <strong>community members who first met online ribbiting in chats, Discords, and Twitter threads</strong>,
          Froggys represents the continuation of the meme and the beginning of a new era. If Bitcoin Frogs proved that frogs belonged on-chain, Froggys aims to prove that frogs can thrive there.

        <h2 className="font-8bit text-xl">Mission</h2>
        <p>
          Froggys is not just another collection, it’s a <strong>movement to revive frog culture on Bitcoin</strong>.
          Our goal is simple: <strong>make frogs great again</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We see Froggys as a way to give the frog meme a new life, one that’s participatory, fun, and unapologetically Bitcoin-native.
          It’s about building a culture that doesn’t wait for leadership from above — but grows from the swamp itself.

        <h2 className="font-8bit text-xl">Cultural Identity</h2>
        <p>
          Froggys builds on the language, memes, and playfulness that made frogs a recognizable part of crypto culture.
          Phrases like <strong>“ribbit”</strong> live on here, but with new life breathed into them by an energized community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through Twitter leaderboards, ribbit challenges, and community-driven activations, Froggys transforms what could have been a quiet legacy into a loud, ongoing movement.
        </p>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h2 className="font-8bit text-xl">The Future</h2>
        <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-3">
          <p>
            Froggys will continue to experiment with culture, memes, and social-fi integrations. From <strong>leaderboards that reward ribbit activity</strong> to verification systems that connect OG frog holders to Froggys, the project is designed to stay alive and adaptive.
          </p>
          <p>
            The frogs are no longer waiting for leadership. <strong>We are the leadership.</strong> The swamp is loading — and Froggys is how we build the next chapter.
